# CBCNewsApp

Create an Android app that fetches and displays a feed of news content.
Base requirements:
● The app should fetch the news content from our API using URL and display
the results in a list. You can style each list item’s UI however you want, but be
sure that each item includes at least a headline, an image, and the date it was
published. Note that the response from this API is not static.
● The app should also be able to filter the list items by type. The 􏿿type􏿿 key in the
JSON is what should be used to do this. How this is realized in the UI is up to
you.
● If the app loses network connectivity, it should communicate that loss in the UI.


# Bonus points:
● Automated unit and/or UI tests.
● Offline persistence of data.
● Pagination.
